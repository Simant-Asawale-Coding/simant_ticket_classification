Capstone Project 3:
Customer Support Ticket Classification:
Objective: Automatically classify customer support tickets into categories (e.g., billing, technical support, product inquiry).
Techniques: Text Preprocessing, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, SVM.
Tools: Python, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Pandas.
Dataset: Customer support ticket datasets, either custom or from public repositories.
General Workflow for Each Project:
Data Collection: Obtain the necessary text data from public datasets or through web scraping.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical representations using techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
Model Development: Train machine learning models to achieve the project's objective.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimization: Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Documentation: Document the process, results, and insights gained from the project.
API: Pickle the model file and Create user testing API using any web framework for demonstration
