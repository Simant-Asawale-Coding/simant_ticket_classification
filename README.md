Simant Support Ticket Classification
Simant Support Ticket Classification is a machine learning-based application designed to automatically classify customer support tickets into predefined categories. This app leverages a model built using the CountVectorizer with an n-gram range of (1, 3) and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to ensure accurate and efficient classification.

Key Features:
Text Preprocessing: The input text is cleaned by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, newlines, multiple whitespaces, and stopwords, ensuring consistent and reliable predictions.
Advanced NLP Techniques: Utilizes a CountVectorizer with n-grams (1, 3) to capture word sequences, improving the model's ability to understand context and classify tickets accurately.
Support Vector Classifier: The model is powered by an SVC, known for its robustness in handling text classification tasks with high accuracy.
Usage:
Simply input a ticket description into the app, and it will return the predicted category, helping streamline customer support processes by automatically routing tickets to the appropriate department.
